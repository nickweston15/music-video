# README

I built this app to learn more about coding with
an AI agent. For this project I used Cursor and was
pleasantly surprised how useful the agent was both in
writing code and teaching me Python as I built the app.

Right now the app is able to authenticate a user through
Spotify's formal authentication process and then display
the song you are currently listening to on the web. It
will refresh every 10 seconds.
